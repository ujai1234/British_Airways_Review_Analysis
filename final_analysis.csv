0,"   BA has a real problem with boarding it's flights. Those who get on first fill the luggage bins with 2 bags, one of which is supposed to be small and under seat only. Cabin staff don't bother implementing their own rules. Subsequent passengers mill up and down the aisle, bumping into each other, searching for space. Boarding this flight took an hour as a result of this nonsense. The incoming flight was late already so our 90 minute flight was 90 minutes late.",ba real problem boarding flight get first fill luggage bin bag one supposed small seat cabin staff bother implementing rule subsequent passenger mill aisle bumping searching space boarding flight took hour result nonsense incoming flight late already minute flight minute late,-0.7783,Negative
1, Our connecting flight from London to Glasgow was canceled and we were forced to wait 12 hours in the airport for a new flight.

2,"   The worst airline I have ever flown with. Allocated the very back row next to the toilets and galley.

Would have been better sitting in the luggage compartment.",worst airline ever flown allocated back row next toilet galley chance getting sleep question asked possible seat movement ignored getting bumped entire time cabin crew walking pushing kart aisle without one apology would better sitting luggage compartment,-0.3915,Negative
3,"   Excellent service levels, proactive crew and superb food and beverages. I found all aspects of the service to be superior to BA business class, even the new BA Club Suites. First Class felt exclusive, the dedicated crew were clearly used to working the premium cabin, enjoying their work, were proactive, friendly, very respectful and the food and beverage offering a considerable step up from business class. The seat, with sliding double doors was spacious, well designed and very comfortable.  British Airways offered a solid First Class service, from Concorde Lounge to boarding (which was actually by group number for a change) to the very warm and genuine welcome on boarding. A consistent, solid, comfortable service from start to finish and if the price was right, I would not hesitate to book First Class with British Airways again.",excellent service level proactive crew superb food beverage found aspect service superior ba business class even new ba club suite first class felt exclusive dedicated crew clearly used working premium cabin enjoying work proactive friendly respectful food beverage offering considerable step business class seat sliding double door spacious well designed comfortable british airway offered solid first class service concorde lounge boarding actually group number change warm genuine welcome boarding consistent solid comfortable service start finish price right would hesitate book first class british airway,0.9926,Positive
4,"  Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them. Do not give them your money, they cant even look after their staff let alone customers. Oh and don't bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back.",booked special holiday partner september arrived way lovely south france booked business class u start holiday right checking told flight booked seat print onto ticket reason already made sure seat booked booked flight nearly year prior going unfortunately arrived gate told would longer sat together one u would fact go economy girlfriend extremely nervous flyer take extra tablet remain calm food pre booked also sat right bottom end flight held gate another couple predicament due lovely money grabbing british airway booking flight ended refusing passenger end even people sat fold chair toilet area eventually arrived france late waiting luggage come airtags stated case fact still heathrow wait day eventually come france point holiday ruined british airway absolutely shocking speak anyone phone number longer use felt stranded foreign country clothes one help use next every day watched case moved tracking air tag frustrating able plan day hope would get call drive way back air port hour way collect case ended going buying new clothes toiletry stuff make best ruined holiday saving receipt thinking would able claim back wrong british airway take zero responsibility fob going insurance british airway pay basic essential pant toothpaste filed complaint got back requested money back business class even decency even respond absolute joke company wish would remove british name nothing british give money cant even look staff let alone customer oh bother trying cancel flight either take money give nothing back,0.8754,Positive
5," Just returned from Chicago, flew out 10 days ago on American Airlines absolutely superb in every way, had high expectations on return flight with BA. What a disappointment. The Airbus A380 may be nice from a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful. Very uncomfortable seats, the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight, the inflight meal was inedible and the service was mediocre at best. Our short flight from Heathrow to Manchester was much improved, very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early. In future we will travel with one of the American carriers.

6,"  BA standards continue to decline every time I fly with them. This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year. Onboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that Do&Co can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was superb - guessing BA are too tight with their budget. Onboard WiFi service is a joke and should be avoided.",ba standard continue decline every time fly time min late departure seems norm ba information rude clueless boarding gate staff club lounge overcrowded dirty grubby cleaning staff could cope many cutback ba going apply become truly low cost year veteran user ba people complained alex cruz cutting cost past year seen decline quickly latest ceo one read occasional article ba improving thing yet see anything substantive seem british staff left amongst cabin crew maybe time name change give flag carrier status proper low cost sadly staff service declined year year onboard catering remains poor surprised co produce rubbish meal sampled turkish airline equivalent august superb guessing ba tight budget onboard wifi service joke avoided,-0.8578,Negative
7,"  Awful. Business class check in queue just as long as for economy, probably because half of the desks were not staffed and Terminal 5 is chaotic. Business lounge overfull, couldn't get seats. Delayed flight, unmanaged chaos at the gate. No drink on boarding, first drink served an hour after take-off. The meal was poor, used to get better in economy on other airlines.

8,"  Not a reliable airline. You cannot trust the timing at all. I had a 6.45am flight, boarding was on time, but then we are sitting in the plane for already (1.5 hours) and the expected departure is still not clear. They have discovered the engine is not working! I am risking to be late for a business meeting in Geneva. How come they bring a not working plane to the gate. The funny thing is that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to Amsterdam. When I arrived to the Airport that time - I was told I don't have a seat. I was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too much. A lot of stress. In the end, on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for 1.5 hours and I have missed the meeting. I thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time, but today I see it's routine for BA not to fly on time.",reliable airline trust timing flight boarding time sitting plane already hour expected departure still clear discovered engine working risking late business meeting geneva come bring working plane gate funny thing another business trip spring also ba amsterdam arrived airport time told seat put next flight several hour get business meeting late still much lot stress end second plane sitting cabin hour missed meeting thought dramatic unlucky case time today see routine ba fly time,0.3612,Neutral
9,"  I take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see I'm not the only traveller to put in words, how absolutely abysmal British Airways are! The only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points. We booked Club Europe months ago. London to Athens, sat in row 3 and told they had run out of food options, only choice was lentil pie or green curry. Returning Athens to London Club Europe. Couldn't check in online as promised so arrived at the airport 3hrs early. To be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being 'bumped' to economy. This airline fails to deliver time and time again. It is a national disgrace and I implore everyone to choose an alternative.

10,"  The worst journey in my life. The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour, but the flight from MXP was on delay. I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack. After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes. Despite that, upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lost. I filled the form and gave to the employee. I was not given any receipt, so I did not have any reference number. BA phone number at SJC simply never answer. I called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address. I had to enter myself online, dealing with a shitty website. They delivered the baggage three days later. I claimed for compensation online, as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receipt. I was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP, but nothing happened, neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJC. Bad customer service. The only positive side was price, but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew , I would never flown by BA.

11," The airplanes and the lounges are worn out, old and broken. From Dallas to Heathrow, multiple first class seating and electronics were non functional and poorly designed.

12," One of the worst experiences on the worst airline. The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues. The time slipped from 17:00 to 20:00 to 22:00 and finally cancelled. There was zero information given. Despite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight. When it was finally cancelled, the BA staff. Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight. Overall the service was shockingly bad, the worst I have experienced from any airline. I will not ever use them again.",one worst experience worst airline flight delayed due earlier technical issue time slipped finally cancelled zero information given despite paying well odds business class booted ba lounge two hour flight finally cancelled ba staff without explanation told everyone go gate another hour made u enter uk via passport control minute wait airport closing sign bag help ba passing gatwick engineer finally helped u locate bag ba completely washed hand u contravention caa rule refused find u accommodation many slept bus stop overnight people young child find somewhere stay yet ba closed left following day replacement flight also late due admin mistake catering liquid hr flight overall service shockingly bad worst experienced airline ever use,-0.9667,Negative
13,"  Cancelled our flight last-minute then moved us onto a flight 2 days later operated by Japan Airlines. We had paid a lot extra for extra legroom seats as I am very tall and they assigned me a middle seat deep in the middle of the plane. Because it was operated by a different airline but booked by BA, neither BA nor the other airline could change my seat over the phone despite seats being available. After 4 hours of waiting in queues and sitting on hold their solution was for me to arrive early at the airport. I did but the seats had already been given away for free by people who had booked directly with that airline and could check in online. I got a £10 meal voucher as compensation for this enormous downgrade on a 14 hour flight. Never again will I fly BA. I would rather fly indirect with better airlines than use this disgrace of an airline again.",cancelled flight last minute moved u onto flight day later operated japan airline paid lot extra extra legroom seat tall assigned middle seat deep middle plane operated different airline booked ba neither ba airline could change seat phone despite seat available hour waiting queue sitting hold solution arrive early airport seat already given away free people booked directly airline could check online got meal voucher compensation enormous downgrade hour flight never fly ba would rather fly indirect better airline use disgrace airline,0.5106,Positive
14," I had a flight from Miami, Florida to Dublin, Ireland, via London's Heathrow airport. The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow. The total delay was roughly an hour, but it was enough to make our connection a challenge, where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin. When we headed to our connection flight, we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed. This was twenty minutes prior to departure time. They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked. Given the busy weekend of travel, we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed. We then waited 3 hours for our luggage, and then took a cab to London's City Airport. The cab fare was roughly $500. When I filed a claim with British Airways, they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare. This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight. The person who rebooked us, told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure. I will never fly this awful airline again. Given the other feedback on this site, it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment.",flight miami florida dublin ireland via london heathrow airport outbound flight miami delayed delayed gate occupied arrived heathrow total delay roughly hour enough make connection challenge minute original arrival time departure time dublin headed connection flight stopped security personnel checkpoint told u gate connection flight already closed twenty minute prior departure time ushered u customer service rebooked given busy weekend travel rebooked flight different airport told cost get would reimbursed waited hour luggage took cab london city airport cab fare roughly filed claim british airway refused claim told plenty time make connecting flight therefore denied claim reimbursed cab fare explained british airway employee ushered u rebook flight despite minute timeframe make connecting flight person rebooked u told u policy close gate minute prior departure never fly awful airline given feedback site appears overwhelming sentiment,-0.6011,Negative
15,  We started our day with BA in Prague. The flight actually left on time! I came to find out that’s very unusual. We purchased business class seats. As you can see from the picture they hardly were business class. All they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class. Horrible flight. In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served. Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began. We had a 4 hour delay. They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay. I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions. They were very rude. At one point there were no employees left. And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed. And there were no weather issues. There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I’ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water. The seat controls didn’t work well. You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything. The power outlet didn’t work. There was no internet the entire flight. The overhead luggage bin was too heavy. I almost got a hernia having to close it. This is a horrible airline. I’ll never fly with them again. If I could give zero stars I would.,started day ba prague flight actually left time came find unusual purchased business class seat see picture hardly business class block middle seat first row called business class horrible flight addition really rude rude check clerk basically yell excused asked could give little bit priority many business class passenger served got heathrow real fun began hour delay gave u different excuse delay employee walk away asking question rude one point employee left announcement seems virtually every ba flight delayed weather issue place comfortably store item business class never experienced even cup holder bottle water seat control work well keep pushing button get anything power outlet work internet entire flight overhead luggage bin heavy almost got hernia close horrible airline never fly could give zero star would,-0.9452,Negative
16,  I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer. The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate. I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst. It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff. My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time.,fly british airway weekly want route option therefore frankly care customer flight always delayed always someone else fault weather delay incoming aircraft flight traffic control issue heard life understand allowed operate around world traveled world airline british airway really worst worst shame watched used good company fall cliff advice option fly anyone else exercise option flying different connection tight schedule expect ba get destination time,-0.9124,Negative
17,"  Everything was ok until our connecting flight in London, just before take off, we were on the runway, the pilot came on to announce an engine problem. After engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us. In fact everyone refused to help us. It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app. Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day. Now it's 10:30pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that. So i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a room. I don't have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I'll be reimbursed, even though I'm not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It's financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it's impossible to reach them by phone.

18,"  My initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flight. Then I was automatically rescheduled for next day. Next day, the flight was delayed leaving Hamburg and missed my connecting flight to Las Vegas. Me and several other passengers spent the night in London. British Airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel (closest to our hotel) and told us that we can walk there if we want to. As a result, I lost two nights hotel reservations that I made in las Vegas. I opened a claim and provided all receipts to British Airways to get refund of my hotel reservations, but over 5 weeks now, not a single feedback from British Airways.

22," Worst BA experience. I was supposed to fly out to Italy on 7 September 2023. I arrived at OR Tambo International airport ready to check my bags in (I already checked-in online the previous evening so I had my boarding pass ready). At the counter I was told that I had been off-loaded from the flight as my connecting flight has been cancelled. No information was sent regarding this beforehand. The team at the check-in counter tried to get me on another flight that evening, but there were no flights available. They did manage to get me another flight the following evening with Lufthansa to Italy via Frankfurt. However, I did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and a half later than I was supposed to. Upon moving the flights I did ask the BA staff whether my flights back are still valid and that everything is in order, which they assured me is correct. I have to fly back to South Africa on 18 September and upon checking my booking information I noticed on my BA account that my first flight (Milan to London) is just missing from my booking. My connecting from London to Johannesburg is still there. After spending the entire morning on the customer helpline two different operators picked up and in both instances, the moment I proceed to give my booking reference number, my call gets dropped.

23,"  My daughter and I were denied boarding on our business class flight from Madrid to Heathrow in March 25, 2023, the first leg on our return flight to Victoria, Canada. No reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the British Airways counter in Madrid, who said they were only agents and told us to call British Airways. We were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports. After many tries we finally reached British Airways by phone, but we were told to call Expedia which had booked the flights. Expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight, with no explanation as to why. Expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights. Over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both Expedia and British Airways. Incredibly, the next available flights were 9 days later on April 3. This was almost unbelievable, but after many many tries it was the best we could do. Even though these were Business Class tickets. Part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight. This nine day delay was a major problem for us. I had to miss work and my daughter was missing school. Further, we received no compensation from British Airways, no penalty fee, and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days. After our return I began the British Airways online complaint process, and submitted all supporting documents. I received an email reply and a case reference number. And then nothing. I sent numerous follow up emails, and received no replies. It is now months later, and still I have not heard from British Airways. This is shocking, and definitely the worst airline service I have received for my thousands of flights over many decades. I am a very patient person and this is the first time I have commented on this type of forum.

28,"  British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers. I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn’t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA’s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don’t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted. At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London!

29," London Heathrow to Keflavik, Iceland in Business Class on an A321. British Airways provides an unusual Business Class experience for intra-Europe flights. The seating is similar to most airlines - middle seat vacant and little extra space - but on British Airways the Business Class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft. This makes it less than a premium experience at every step, from boarding to onboard. The WiFi worked for only half the flight and there are no refunds. But when it worked it was surprisingly fast.

30," Mumbai to London Heathrow in Business Class on an ageing B777-200. This aircraft featured the older Club World flatbed seats. They are comfortable, there is enough storage space around the cubicle, and the monitor screen is among the larger ones I've seen on airplanes. BA's new Club Suites are said to be far superior, competing with the best B-class rivals. The entire Business Class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it wasn't an issue on this flight since the premier section wasn't at full capacity. There was Wi-Fi on board, fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps. Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth. The food was alright and no more. The biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 1:10 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from India. The airport experience is far more pleasant at this time. In summary: British Airways provides a good, but not spectacular, Business Class product.",mumbai london heathrow business class ageing b aircraft featured older club world flatbed seat comfortable enough storage space around cubicle monitor screen among larger one seen airplane ba new club suite said far superior competing best b class rival entire business class cabin washroom issue flight since premier section full capacity wi fi board fast enough even send video via messaging apps service onboard competent staff lacked warmth food alright biggest plus flight get bombay pm afternoon instead ungodly early morning hour international flight take india airport experience far pleasant time summary british airway provides good spectacular business class product,0.9735,Positive

32,  Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable. How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off. Are there any redeeming features - the answer is no. If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague.,flying business class pleasure ba made disaster worst seating configuration imaginable could sane person could jam many seat limited space expect passenger happy seat narrower economy airline must face another person plastic screen raised tv screen size medium sized tablet control behind head sitting position put anything except one small pull draw ground level reached seated accessed sleeping window seat middle seat accessed jump passenger aisle seat seat low hard elderly get whole business class set sick joke eating difficult seat close enough table table flimsy drink fall redeeming feature answer like little comfort avoid ba like plague,-0.4792,Negative
33,"  British Airways absolutely does not care. My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight, full flight and it was quite awful. After enquiring at LAX check in, the agent said sorry, nothing we can do. Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed, with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice. Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that. No water runs, if you need anything do not bother with the call bell, as they simply ignore it. I used to like travelling British Airways 10-15 years ago, but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier. I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service. My last trip to London was with Delta, they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become.",british airway absolutely care reserved seat change aisle center seat overnight full flight quite awful enquiring lax check agent said sorry nothing onboard flight attendant seemed try finish meal service racing speed meal tray passed proper question choice back clearing tray disappeared rest kitchen hour water run need anything bother call bell simply ignore used like travelling british airway year ago bean counter lowered close lowcost carrier guess staff badly paid terrible attitude service last trip london delta much better poor excuse airline british air become,-0.875,Negative
34,"  My recent experience with British Airways was not just horrendous, it was an utter abdication of responsibility on their part. I arrived at JFK ready for my flight to Malaga, only to find it had been cancelled with zero notice. After a draining 2-hour altercation, I was finally placed on a different flight. The nightmare continued when I landed in Malaga sans luggage, containing essentials for my son's wedding. Thirty agonizing hours later, the bags showed up—but my brand-new iPad and a special watch for my nephew were missing. The items weren't merely valuable; they had emotional significance, which made the loss even more gut-wrenching. You'd think a reputable airline would make amends for such  errors.  Despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team, they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit. Their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous. Their response was, in essence, ""It's your fault for trusting us with your belongings."" This isn't just poor customer service; it's a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility. British Airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not to. If you have any respect for your time, belongings, and emotional well-being, avoid British Airways at all costs. They not only fail to deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err, leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence.",recent experience british airway horrendous utter abdication responsibility part arrived jfk ready flight malaga find cancelled zero notice draining hour altercation finally placed different flight nightmare continued landed malaga sans luggage containing essential son wedding thirty agonizing hour later bag showed brand new ipad special watch nephew missing item merely valuable emotional significance made loss even gut wrenching think reputable airline would make amends error despite clear mishandling baggage team refused offer reimbursement even modest amount airline credit customer service ineffective also astonishingly callous response essence fault trusting u belonging poor customer service complete disregard basic human decency responsibility british airway numerous opportunity right wrong chose respect time belonging emotional well avoid british airway cost fail deliver promise also refuse make amends err leaving customer bear brunt incompetence,-0.9391,Negative
35,"  This is to express our displeasure and concerns regarding our flight to Italy. Our trip was effectively ruined by the failure of our luggage to arrive with us, coupled with the length of time it took for it to eventually reach us (9 and 12 days)! Our departure dates: June 19, 2023 - Flight BA 294, Chicago to London. June 20 rebooked by BA on BA 546, London to Rome. All flights were late. On arrival in Rome, my wife was forced to walk to the check-in desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by BA. She was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport. Also, our checked baggage (2) failed to make the BA rebooked flight from London to Rome. BA took 9 days to deliver my bag and 12 days to deliver my wife's. I called BA Baggage Claim Services daily. I was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour. We had Apple Air tags in both bags, and sent pictures showing their exact location to BA Baggage Claim several times. After 5 days, BA stated that they found my wife's bag, but needed to verify ownership! Both bags as described had bright pink 4” easily visible tags and bright pink bows. Taking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusable. Our return date: July 3 - BA 553, Rome to London. BA 297, London to Chicago. All flights were late. We arrived in Chicago more than 3 hours late, missing our ground transportation to our home in Michigan (3 hours away). We had to find a hotel and stay overnight near Chicago. On July 12 we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries, also for food purchased at Heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in Chicago. After 2 weeks, I went online asking for some follow-up on both cases, but have had no response at all from BA. We are retirees on fixed income, and cannot fund BA’s errors. I can honestly say that the times I was able to reach a human being, they were all courteous and attempted to help, but appeared at a loss.

36,"  I flew London to Malaga on 27 August in Club Europe. We stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for over an hour, with staff giving very different reasons for the delay, late inbound aircraft etc - but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour! After boarding, the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served. This is Club Europe, and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight. No effort to apologise. We smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a Club Europe meal tray. Cabin crew also had warmed pastries ( and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley!) while customers received zilch. BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry - nothing else. What a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things. I paid a full Business class fare, did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient.

37,"  I arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in, go through security, etc. All that went without any issues. Being that I was relatively early at the gate, I was one of the first passengers there. After some time boarding had opened. First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they won’t let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in. The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn’t be let in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn’t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways. Since they don’t have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone went to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyone’s flight nor get anyone refunded. All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the check-in counter to get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I had missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it. We are supposed to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which I would not know if I ever got it backed.",arrived airport hour takeoff time get checked go security etc went without issue relatively early gate one first passenger time boarding opened first business class got called family child disabled people couple minute boarding started call people one one name announcement let anyone anymore fifty people still standing gate let reason said plane short staffed later discovered speaking manager flight short staffed also overbooked announcement people getting angry let anymore nothing changed everyone sent away connecting flight later day going miss let plane first tried get luggage back receive immediately got hold later thanks airport personnel like everyone going fly plane wanted talk someone british airway since service center frankfurt airport everyone went check counter received food voucher single person either able rebook anyone flight get anyone refunded staff said going receive email couple hour option rebook flight get refund waited four hour email airport come today trying call airline help either answer phone hung middle conversation four hour waiting email people flight went back check counter get confirmation receive refund new shift personell know happened scanned passport looked flight found system dying fault could attend flight looked like missed everyone standing exactly people counter said could anything later able speak manager many phone call said going take care supposed get email point future able get written confirmation get refunded even several time asking already flew lot time life never ever thing happened many people let plane also customer service horrible able rebook confirm refund way end option get destination would book last minute flight lot money would know ever got backed,0.4588,Neutral

The dinner offering was equally ample and delicious. The inflight entertainment had a great collection of TV and current films and the inflight map was first rate.

There was no lounge access offered. The boarding process was well handled. British Airways Business Class seats for the Club Europe product are terrible - exactly the same as Economy with the middle seat left vacant. You don't even get extra pitch.

59," Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.",terrible experience british airway booked flight ba travel gibraltar london heathrow may flight scheduled leave p afternoon originally planned leaving luggage heathrow upon arrival travelling visit overnight cousin place en route gib airport hour prior departure checked flight detail found flight cancelled connecting flight booked westjet london heathrow vancouver following day make flight imperative got london checked ba website find flight would work unfortunately made mistake requesting refund managed find flight malaga got london p booked called british airway wanted discus compensation advised requested refund used phrase abandoned travel prepared anything apparently called first would made arrangement course explain website ask want refund proceed even plead case agent malaga airport followed customer relation several time via email flat refused budge used travel voucher cover cost flight used avios cover cost checked baggage word pocket cost trip incident happened ended spending euro airfare checked baggage charge get london malaga e different airport one originally booked luggage storage facility heathrow closed time eventually arrived ended booking night hotel since travel train cousin place longer bag tow want put drive airport pick cost another room meal cost ba ended compensate give free avios mere pittance compared pocket expense despite trying explain requested refund instead calling first budge easy say done since work know rule one scrambling find alternative travel arrangement within hour pointed website simply instruct customer call situation happens way would never encounter problem feeling put refund option hope customer make mistake wash hand situation ultimately save money executive club member year simply care said nothing could sure one ba executive friend family member gone staff would given instruction make thing right used fan ba really gone downhill opinion used remaining avios travel credit cancel executive club membership never fly,0.8892,Positive

First, it took me two hours to do the check-in online due to a technical problem. I also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a UK number from my Spanish cell phone because that’s the only service they provide on weekends. Then, at the airport, when there was the boarding time, we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on. They just told us to wait. Finally we could access the plane. After 40 minutes inside, they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled. We had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours. Then, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed! We spent almost 12 hours at the airport. No information was provided, no solutions were offered. We had to seat in the last raw (when I had paid to seat on the first half of the plane). No money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given. I also had pre-purchased food and they couldn’t provide the service. All in all, terrible.

64," A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.",simple story unfortunate outcome really could happen anyone partner recently started working studying purchased two ticket travel london city airport frankfurt purchased ticket mistakenly entered name twice e g mr john smith m john smith little know simple mistake would cost u pound upon arriving airport told way change name apparently change letter typo option purchase last remaining ticket wanted board flight price almost seven time higher original ticket zero empathy shown zero alternative offered trusting ba staff pretence apparently way could board flight bought ticket immediately purchased ticket contacted ba commercial change booking team informed situation service representative apologised told could changed name cost small fee offered cancel original ticket issue partial refund advising claim difference contact customer support told person several time wanted claim cost new ticket even asked explicitly accepting offer would denied claiming cost new ticket said could claim difference fair enough accepted offer lodged ticket customer support difference two day later british airway customer response informed u unable lodge claim voluntarily accepted cancellation flight continued send generic email week stopped responding short british airway misled deceived partner accepting lowball offer waive right claim refund keep night thinking get away easily,0.8107,Positive
65,"  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes !

73,"  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each.

We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. Once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn't leave the boarding area. I will never fly this airline again!

77,"  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person.

We have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. After multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded.

84,"  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA.

88,"  We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits.

91,"  This is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the BA flight from London City to Ibiza. Economy was excellent. A very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business. I didn't eat, so I paid £100 for nothing. Oh well. So great flight but stick with economy.",two one review covering economy business class ba flight london city ibiza economy excellent light lunch small cheese pastrami sandwich chocolate brownie followed pretty much free flowing drink trolley flight full crew worked hard good job flight would recommend except fall last minute offer upgrade business direction flew economy business back brother flew business economy business seat identical economy seat blocked squished four abreast meal almost identical minor tweak yoghurt real plus champagne flight none supply issue cabin attendant think name tom must one best business eat paid nothing oh well great flight stick economy,0.937,Positive

95,  This flight failed at every level. We were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a BA holiday. We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. As there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday evening. Having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday. I might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available.

They won't treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home. It extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as well. No offers of compensation or upgrades were made. And now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensation. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on.

104,"  I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there.

I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints.

115,"  My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again.

118," Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again.

121,". The BA first lounge at Terminal 5 was a  zoo at 2pm, dirty tables and used tableware everywhere. Worse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins late. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class. Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips. I thought post Covid that BA were better for a few months, but with the many cost cuts they are making, they fall well below all other European full service Airlines. ",ba first lounge terminal zoo pm dirty table used tableware everywhere worse usual atrocious boarding gate service boarding started min late flight operated finnair barely low cost standard let alone business class hard thin uncomfortable seat poor legroom cabin simply tatty remain shocked ba allow time ba ceo management focused standard rather bean counting finnair cabin staff fundamentally courteous provide trimmed budget airline type service whole trip turned yet business class ticket one expensive recent trip thought post covid ba better month many cost cut making fall well european full service airline,-0.7584,Negative
122," Paid a quick visit to Nice yesterday from Heathrow. Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. I paid over £300 for a business class round trip. I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded. Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times. I was glad it was only a two hour flight.

123,"  Words fail to describe this last awful flight - baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight LHR/SFO, it's understandable for a baby to cry nonstop - but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin - that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep (always difficult anyway westbound). The food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd service. What happened to the really nice tea and scones? I've said this before after suffering through the BA concept of customer service (i.e. don't do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work) - this time i swear i mean it - never again on BA please!

If BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could have made our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations.

128," I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time.

130,"  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways.

There are no proactive updates, no empathy, no care but a lot of actual lies being told.

134," Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service.

135," I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022. When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations.

142,  Worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British Airways. So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.,worst experience life trying deal customer service british airway many issue getting one destination absolutely horrible time trying get answer reach anyone capable helping navigate uncertainty wrote formal complaint requesting type refund received generic sorry email avios attached equivalent maybe flight needle say go waste refuse fly untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline even address one single issue expressed equivalent handing band aid slapping face say flight smooth onboard staff kind attentive frustrating thing customer service trained give runaround heavily point exhaustion give trying take loss,-0.9601,Negative
143,"  Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew.

144,"  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling. Do not waste your money on Club Europe, standards just keep dropping. ",lhr check quick first wing quickly security first lounge quiet change reasonably good breakfast buffet available ba brought back highlife magazine lounge seems used covid scrap magazine used offer part endless ba cost cutting toilet lounge disgusting ever cleaned frequently visit year date public washroom better cleaner boarding usual ba muddled mess two gate staff appeared clue endless announcement gate full flight requesting passenger check bag get flight le full onboard good welcome captain flight left gate min late breakfast choice fair standard hot towel even packet towel offered club europe another part relentless ba cost cutting mind fare proportionately lot higher pre covid cabin staff service perfunctory best scrap recognition ba gold oneworld emerald member clear proof ba really care breakfast tray cleared min flight sign staff stay front galley rest flight paid hour wifi dropped connection next min sad note staff service ryanair pro active nowadays priority tagged suitcase came nearly last malaga standard ba business class baggage handling waste money club europe standard keep dropping,0.9509,Positive
145,"  I wouldn't recommend British Airways at all. I tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and I waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone! I ended hanging up. They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn't recommend.

146,"  Absolutely horrible experience. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3?

The boarding process was chaotic, both in the airport and onto the plane. But more importantly, although we were in business class, it wasn’t really business class. There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there. And those seats, like the rest, were extremely cramped and uncomfortable.

155,"  Obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years. Prices have increased and services have gone down. The most disappointing thing about BA is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have. The check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive, shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying. Airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in Asia where the service industry is next level. I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful. However there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious.

158," Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through.

159," Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn't too bad. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey...

Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room. After some discussion, they agreed to change it. I went to the alternate room, to my horror, it was occupied. I asked the staff to call a cab, and I left.

166,"  I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you. Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal. The last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid. It was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I will now have to see if I can change them. The pathetic 250 ml bottle of water, it's just a sip.

168," First time flying with British Airways and first time flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrow. I chose Premium Economy at a reasonable price. I was quite comfortable, however, the first leg of the flight from Mumbai to Heathrow, the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest. The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight.

170,"  Booked a flight return flight between London and Munich for 3/11 to 3/17 in December. The return flight was cancelled and re-booked from 3/17 to 3/12. British Airways only notified me of the first change, but not the second. Getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions. Each time needing to find a helpful representative. British Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket. They tried to charge an $800 change fee. Through repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6. To make sure it did not get changed again, i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15. It was intact those days. On 3/16 when it was time to check-in for the flight, it was gone. At the airport the staff at the British Airways check-in counter are not BA employees, so cannot help resolve problems. There are no BA representative at the Munich Airport.

173,"  
Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option.

174,"  If I could give a minus rating, I would. Supposed to be LHR-AMS at 14.05 on 13th March. Get to LHR at 12.00, email to say flight cancelled. No one able to help at LHR, said to use the app. Only halfway sensible option was from LCY-AMS at 17.05, so taxi over there as trains from LHR not working (ok, not BA's fault). Get to LCY, showing as cancelled on screen, so check the app and there it is. Rebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to desk to drop bag and was told that I was only on standby for the flight, with no guarantee of a seat, despite the app telling me it was confirmed. The 18.35 to AMS was already overbooked so was moved onto the 19.30 flight to Rotterdam. The 15.30 and 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happened. Eventually took off and the best thing I can say is that it landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelled. Quickly check app, and confirmed it was. No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight. Overall, dreadful. They just don't care and hide behind apps and automated call centres.

176,"  We were flying World Traveller Plus their Premium service. What it was not was Premium. We have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly Premium most times. BA's premium is the worst I have come across. The flight from Heathrow to JFK was just ok, the flight back was in a plane that should not be used. Old, dirty, uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had, one would not recline and one reclined without using the button. BA needs to look at the Premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs. They have fallen far behind their competitors, they were once my preferred airline but now I try and avoid at all costs.

177,  This was literally one of the worst experiences. I haven’t been to an airport since. It began in Orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for 6 hours. Poor customer service and just ignored at times. Then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags. Even though I booked through to Dublin. Another 4 hours I was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight. Another hour later I was handed a card with a number and told to ring it. I was cut off three times and told I wouldn’t be able to get home that day despite several flights being available.

178,"  The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.",usual shambolic unfolding ba unfortunately come known long weekend flight booked munich supposed departing th february happened first flight newborn month old daughter turned horror show incompetence hr scheduled departure original th february flight cancelled received email boarding heathrow express booked day holiday work trip ended getting round trip paddington instead way back cancelled flight wife tried calling ba despite one u silver membership possibly largest joke membership currently took u nearly minute speak someone could help believe ba outsource call centre end talking people following script result might well speaking ai rather human often received response similar computer say service level silver member imagine regular punter put phone originally connected person wait minute computer booted ba proceeded auto book u onto new flight next day going different destination original flight munich auto booked replacement flight salzburg asking robot ba call centre booked u replacement flight location km apart understand frustration eventually someone able book u onto flight following day ideal wasted valuable day work hotel refund u move booking least going munich salzburg day new flight came round time managed get way check desk upon arriving check desk told rebooked flight cancelled minute earlier email text notification ever arrived ba tell u flight cancelled incomprehensible could possibly happened check person said get app rebook point know whether explode anger cry luckily another check person ounce sympathy explained useless check person could actually rebook u booked onto another flight later evening ba unfortunately meant hr grotty lounge month old baby appears everyone access lounge really difference lounge hostel get free stuff former pleasant experience eventually arrive munich despite asking get push chair stroller delivered front plane plane characteristically ba dumping ground used give sanitising wipe could clean seat tray table seemed cut back service another shocking ba service lost day holiday ounce empathy sympathy understanding employee interacted,-0.4588,Negative
179,  Lost my case and took 6 weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after 8 weeks. I had a business class flight scheduled on Dec 12 2022 … Manchester > Copenhagen -Bangkok and return flight Dec 27 2022 … Bangkok > Stockholm > Manchester. SAS Airlines left Manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control. When I arrived in Copenhagen to get the connecting flight for Bangkok we were 10 minutes too late and the flight had gone (half of the plane missed it).. SAS Airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being … Copenhagen (SAS) > London (BA) > Dubai (Emirates) > Bangkok. I returned from Copenhagen to London and the collected my boarding pass at BA. We were over 2 hours late leaving London due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight. We arrived in Dubai late and was informed the flight had gone. Emirates then informed me that I had to speak with Thai Air to get another flight issued. I spent over an hour phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the phone. I then spoke with Thai Air Dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that I buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later. I paid £1279.43 for a Kuwait Airways flight out of Dubai > Kuwaiti > Bangkok.

181,"  Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before.

197,"  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.",review relates appalling experience british airway th february due travel madrid british airway setting heard radio flight delay looked heathrow airport website saw flight cancelled result information website called british airway minute hold found speaking somebody call centre south africa person hard understand due heavy accent incompetent insisted flight cancelled made way heathrow sure enough flight indeed cancelled woman question audacity declare flight cancelled facility airport rebook refused let people join queue clearly marked assistance desk woman one colleague gave card telephone number told one rather elderly gentleman go online rebook seat visually impaired found attitude ba employee appalling called number card employee gave long queue call centre person picked phone kept waiting minute declared flight cancelled airport must wrong flippant tone said informed flight indeed cancelled would go speak iberia customer service heathrow rebook took elderly gentleman iberia counter staff member rolled eye disgust said nothing iberia returned ba time joined check line told check agent happened man question booked onto next available flight within matter minute gave voucher form compensation said could add frequent flyer number partner airline voucher proved useless afraid various shop predepature area refused accept although told could use clearing security none shop would accept aboard new flight service minimal tiny bottle water packet pretzel nothing else available full flight many people transferred cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced additional item small bottle water pretzel ordered via skyshop,-0.9715,Negative

Both Wizz Air and EasyJet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage. British Airways were the most convenient and best value option available, they offered ideal flight times and the €18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable - Total cost for both flights was €126 +/- Regular update information via email, seamless online seat allocation and check in. Efficient staff at the check in desks at PMI and LGW ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible. Immaculate aircraft, comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom (I'm 6'4"" tall) Cabin crew were polite, friendly and professional.

202,"  My husband and myself were flying to Madrid on the 3rd of February for a Legal matter and we had to be in Madrid by 13:00 pm. We had booked our flight and car with BA Holidays. Unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before, we got lost, and missed our 6:00 am flight to Madrid. I tried to stay calm, cold head and we went to British Airways to get help. The first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with BA Holidays, we didn't know that, she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldn't do anything else, that we had to call that number. We called the number, which was asking us to call another  number, which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm, We went back to the lady and explained that we couldn't wait until 8 am, but she told us that she could not do anything. I did reach out to another staff , a lovely young lady called Althea. She started to look at it, made several calls, went to check with someone else to an office, she managed to get someone to send me a text message that I had to call, and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line, modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 7.30 am. They didn't charge us for that, our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to Madrid.

204,"  Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout.

210,"  This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.

212,"  As a Spanish born individual living in England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago).",spanish born individual living england using british airway decade multiple time year th january booked flight son go alicante however informed th january doctor unable fly due elbow operation result decided give ticket daughter calling customer service team british airway make change th january took enquiry call seemed speech delay call presented small bit difficulty however also struggled understand support staff member top delay requesting change name one ticket daughter name told within policy would need cancel ticket rebook encouraged divide booking son two different booking reference number accepted asked would like cancel booking insisted would need know total refund lucky ask check informed would roughly total cost booking come per passenger leaving refund total le value purchase despite seat abandoned according ba policy entitled simple change name le refund even buying ticket right back phone probably money worth week ago,0.8669,Positive

216,"  I find BA incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers. I have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although I know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage. There was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones.

217,"  Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible.

218,"  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.

220," Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water.

My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat.

223," I must admit like many others I tend to avoid BA long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews. But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that’s about it. IFE didn’t work but wasn’t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think.

225,  Paid £200 day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy. At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10.

227,"  Absolutely terrible experience with British Airways. After a short flight from London Heathrow to Frankfurt, they couldn't get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight (on Cathay Pacific) to Melbourne, despite a 3 hour gap between the two flights. Told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to Melbourne - instead, it got to Hong Kong and left there. When they finally tracked it down, they sent it back to London. All happened over Christmas, so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team. While the plane crew may be lovely, the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful, and if given the option, I will avoid flying with them in future.",absolutely terrible experience british airway short flight london heathrow frankfurt get suitcase time next flight cathay pacific melbourne despite hour gap two flight told would arrange suitcase transferred directly melbourne instead got hong kong left finally tracked sent back london happened christmas stressful yet minimal communication team plane crew may lovely service outside nothing short dreadful given option avoid flying future,-0.3993,Negative
228,"  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for.

People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it.

234,"  Boarding – at gate at LGW they called Group 1 to board (we were World Traveller Plus & Group 3), then called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward. Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew.

236,"  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff.

I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better.

Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet).

244,"  I was flying to Warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami the next day. Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami.

246," Extremely sub-par service. Highlights: No online meal selection. Staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. Last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. Plates were literally grabbed away. I had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. No apology. No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. Staff walked down with some water and biscuits.

251," This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle.

Boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good!

259,"  I’ve generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with BA if they fly the route I’m after but my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. We should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr + flight. Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. They were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board.

262,"  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys.",year ago flying ba enjoyable time changed day five hour board plane fun terminal experience still feel classy way felt well staffed efficient board though become experience endured ba mean decision split seat nicer first half plane nastier rest underline entertainment magazine refreshment purchase brought seat ordering app attempt provide fresh hot food day despite competition able much ask trapped board five hour get free tiny bottle water small cereal bar outbound flight crew collected rubbish landing helpfully tied bag around toilet door back case anyone wanted fight way past clear thing recline button deleted seat seat pitch feel squeezed return flight one reason another due ba delay previous day two hour late getting plane late evening passenger travel enough crew cabin crew nonetheless distinctly professional flight altogether would say good thing hard think anything could recommend ba pity used professional company deal pleasure worth looking forward making european journey,0.9776,Positive

Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered.

The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good.

266,"  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken.

First ride on an A380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice.

When the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. The seat itself wasn't too bad but I felt squished and locked in. On a plus side, having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side. Ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice. Plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night. Dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack. The entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies, tv, music and games.

Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Glass of champagne, Coronation Chicken Salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter. In spite of some of the issues with BA, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception.

277," The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation.",check process smooth got access iga lounge nice nice turkish airline lounge board flight first time flying intra european business class though well prepared still found underwhelming first seat normal economy seat middle seat blocked personal ife basically entertainment hour flight meal service slow time reached half business class cabin one choice ran plus meal good economy meal got turkish airline flight day ago could see staff best since business class passenger single aisle aircraft small galley much could also passenger shared one single wc meaning long line bath room something rarely seen business class arrived lhr get contact gate thing bus either crew announced idea bus would come finally came course delay airport airline since ba main operator heathrow thing affect reputation,0.9509,Positive
278," This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class.",first time flying ba new club suite opinion good flight u including mine departed concourse c terminal many shopping dining option however quiet finding seating quite easy highlight club suite spacious provides great deal privacy meal service slow everything served one tray think time begin get back pre pandemic standard least food tasted good something previously experienced ba flight even first class,0.941,Positive
279,"  My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow - Jersey. However, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel to my destination.

First of all, the improvement in the BA lounge in Gatwick is massive. The buffet was a joy. We flew on a BA flight but operated by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service.

I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough.

306,"  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line.

307,"  Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands.

309,"  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.",three flight london reykjavik return frankfurt london generally flight acceptable standard though seat legroom quite tight three hour flight cabin crew efficient generally friendly big plus ba informative announcement cockpit often missing airline flight operated generally close advertised time ba let chaotic check boarding procedure preparation flight number check staff one two frankfurt lone check agent also checking business class passenger economy class passenger boarded front back standard across three flight slowed boarding process immensely people seated back tried get past forward seated passenger stowing enormous cabin baggage would make much sense board people back first enforce baggage rule cabin crew wandering cabin trying find overhead space hapless passenger boarded last small bottle water half full bag crisp offered snack three hour flight iceland tokenism compared badly air france offered subsequent short flight paris reykjavik departure lounge next gate passenger queue wherever could corridor,-0.5267,Negative

As a very loyal BA customer for more than 40 years, I am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays.

This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise.

316,"  Today, my husband and a friend flew from Dublin to London City Airport. All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim"").

A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles.

The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat.

326,"  BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees.  I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022.

Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co.

The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor.

331,"  As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago).

However, in my many attempts to receive communication from this company, it has been nothing but disappointment and upset. The company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband. The most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if I don’t?”. After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold. I did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone).

337,"  Feels like BA are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. Very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew. However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point?",feel like ba putting economy back premium economy pleasant friendly helpful cabin crew however two hour food served already delayed pm flight single drink offered plastic cup meal service food offered wine crew could come back later wanted something else including water drank wine anyway leap offer given long took food never experienced airline premium economy product flew westjet year took drink order boarded brought meal glassware brilliant air new zealand glass use name throughout water eventually came round eaten say crew pleasant friendly seemed equipped staffed following poor procedure food forgettable flight entertainment great screen large unfortunately every seatbelt light announcement screen brightness level reset retina searing default fun night flight turbulence loo gatwick halfway economy pandemonium back upside layout pe next exit deplaned quickly check queue cancun took forever see hear gate announcement everyone crowded gate grateful priority boarding situation bag arrived ok gatwick delay continue avoid ba unless using avios business class alternative ba problem seem easy fix cabin crew clearly eager help equipped given service procedure match airline price point,0.9885,Positive

Once in Hamburg, there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a dead-end; no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee. A group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to no avail.

It was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated. She repeatedly asked if I needed anything as I had Arham in my lap most of the time.

343,"  Recent trip to Boston, departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere.

345,"  As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge. However they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that I incurred as a result of their mistake.",seasoned traveller loyal ba customer appalled company recent drop standard booked fly zhr lhr mile ticket february arrived check several hour scheduled departure informed would pay baggage even though ticket clearly included free checked baggage held check hour whilst check agent went consult manager confirmed would pay check baggage option pay charge however result delay check arrived gate find flight closed last flight day forced find expensive overnight hotel accommodation tried contact ba customer service incident numerous occasion however bothered respond rd attempt cc ceo complaint got one line response saying free baggage included ticket point got solicitor write letter finally agreed refund baggage charge however refusing compensate missed flight considerable expense loss incurred result mistake,-0.8583,Negative

To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me.

The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response.

After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document.

On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website.

After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking.

If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered.

Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight.

We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.

365," I connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit.",connected madrid iberia wrote scathing review awful long haul business class service british airway short haul business class totally different class cabin row seat bc record staff met u door cheerful way sign highly professional way would continue look u throughout flight messaging cabin crew flight crew excellent food first class nothing much staff oh two member company offer different level sift hard service thought must ingrained ethic company british airway keep good work would better proper business class seat like european competitor overall made feel proud brit,0.9349,Positive

367,"  I have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline. Having paid almost £1K extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, BA cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later. There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket. The poor level of hygiene, overcrowding, delays, cancellations makes this the worst airline I have had to endure.

368," Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt BA had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers.",business lounge closed pisa airport probably beyond control british airway closed since january least british airway could done would issued customer paid service voucher used airport complained ba compensation said would credit account avios point felt adequate compensation point felt ba handled situation prompt professional manner however seven week ago avios point added account called call centre multiple time one point put hold hour put right department phone answered told wrong department phone number read number calling scenario replayed probably twenty time clear ba intention resolving making customer go round circle give airline absolutely appalling way treat customer,0.5677,Positive

373,"  We booked a business class flight with Qantas from Melbourne to Glasgow via London. As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed.

Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.

377,"  I am constantly amazed how British Airways continue to get things wrong - I pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last 15 years living in the UK, I have watched their decline with great sadness. My flight to Paris was no exception. Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris. As it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attend.

378,"  The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline.

Easy check in, decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers, very clean plane which left on time, ridiculous amount of legroom in 2D (it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1A or C), reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable CSM and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled.

391,"  Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin.

The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals. No snacks were offered during the flight. This is so different to every other airline we have used in the past. After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos.

394,"  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy.

395,"  British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow.",british airway process upgrading fleet new club suite ba yr old packed like sardine club world product lounge cpt also bursting seam food order behind many passenger left time food arrived boarding surprised find menu amenity kit bottle water already placed storage drawer suspect another cynical time saving initiative part ba frustratingly menu turned incorrect replacement dish probably worst ever encountered business class airline drink run cancelled without warning spurious basis passenger nut allergy hard avoid suspicion cabin crew economical truth apart rather turbulent ride flight otherwise uneventful arrival slightly ahead schedule baggage handling however atrociously slow,-0.8851,Negative
396,"  We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time. We were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy.",flew funchal madeira yesterday madeira covid restriction entry yet ba asked u upload nh vaccination pass could check online received ok hour later husband check online arrive heathrow hour departure stood long queue check desk open queue approx traveller several people went break disappeared one desk open queue barely moving went complain various ba staff said manager told people coming one blonde lady walked around age shepherding traveller queue sitting desk another man later likewise making u wonder simply worked desk beginning stood queue good hour almost running security queue thankfully moved quickly hurriedly bought sandwich walked departure gate stood bus plane whole experience extremely stressful took best part hour time sit plane completely unnecessary able check online would happened husband vaccination pas fine required madeira think system failure received email yesterday morning saying pas order even though previously told could check online also unnecessary ba staffed desk properly queue would moved staff member told u ba laid lot staff lock begging return treated badly want flight fine time given bag crisp bottle water fine nothing praise worthy,0.2086,Neutral

Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready.

400," I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well.

We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food.

402," One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket.

403,"  We will never use BA again for a long haul flight. Our experience of the flight from LHR-MLE wasn’t too bad, apart from a screaming child but the return wasn’t a good experience. We weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen.

Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware.

410," The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean.

423," BA cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later. We had no issue with this, just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible. However, they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from LHR and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at ATL. The aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacity. Service was excellent, staff were friendly and efficient. Dinner was good, breakfast was disappointing with little choice. The LHR to BHD leg was equally good and I am beginning to think that BA are getting their mojo back again.",ba cancelled original return flight rebooked u day later issue enjoyed extra day holiday others might flexible however overlooked rebooking connecting flight lhr fortunate still space flight checked atl aircraft newish excellent condition flight around capacity service excellent staff friendly efficient dinner good breakfast disappointing little choice lhr bhd leg equally good beginning think ba getting mojo back,0.9776,Positive
424," Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. Overall, a good flight.",boarding slow uncomfortable account lack air con gate club suite cabin full rest plane much occupancy whether reason cabin crew flight cut bare minimum hard say certainly work hard covering multiple cabin despite drink food service business efficient current policy serving course meant dinner done dusted two hour take real bonus night time flight however quality food remains mediocre best pasta dish almost inedible club suite big improvement ancient cw product although storage funny arrangement tiny compartment invite losing smartphone two one definitely miss drawer foot level old cw large screen really improves viewing experience whole ife system much responsive new seat significantly aid sleeping particularly obvious ridge level base spine waking two hour touchdown definitely recommended order get breakfast avoid usual queue toilet performance flight deck usual high standard arrival twenty minute ahead schedule progress border control speedy baggage collection delayed unspecified reason overall good flight,0.9712,Positive
425,"  Unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. The good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. The bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife’s didn’t, and post iPad era just don’t live up. The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff. I’m afraid BA has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels.",unfortunately flown new club world cabin time incredibly old plane good cabin crew tried make trip pleasant possible bad flight entertainment screen unwatchable worked wife post ipad era live food okay without anything special served apparently crew explained shortage staff afraid ba lot regain standing aviation world competition fierce sit laurel,0.2513,Neutral
426,"  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich was inedible.

427, Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing! ,past year flown british airway twice ended exact predicament wait around day london heathrow hour flight home newcastle holiday plane staff fantastic customer service staff heathrow useless first time february got stuck heathrow due storm ciara travelling home work airline fault however handling situation staff airport joke staff ran kiosk queue unhappy traveller whilst could set mini kiosk unused gate get everyone quicker crowd control one point queuing hour plus staff decided shut shop end hour battle lucky enough get home last flight day sheer luck finally spoke someone november decided give ba second chance booked go new york since plane landed late lhr missed connecting flight could avoided staff heathrow assisted held plane short rushed custom manage make gate minute spare plane still terminal since taken luggage flight told go service desk refused let since moved later flight layover hour got guest service food voucher spend phone number thought complaint hold minute found complaint considering fact could avoidable assistance given food voucher seemed really cheap day got home raised complaint expressing annoyed waited month response chasing find complaint staff working got response said wanted back holiday got apology told staff heathrow better term good compensation offered nothing,-0.4215,Negative
428,"  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested.

429,"  I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately.

430,"  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra?

431,"  I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days.",flown ba many year today another poor experience witnessed airline decline sub par service understand tough two year airline ba decline started pandemic truly plummeted enormous queue jfk ba check terminal even priority lane standstill least half hour people started complaining miss flight terrible efficiency check counter time one member staff processing people whilst ba staff stood around phone chat one member staff stopped processing man desperately trying catch flight order start processing someone else jumped interior plane generally filthy crumb bit food stain mark around seating area give single wet wipe used think hand see passenger wiping surrounding area good courteous member staff also awful member staff behave unprofessionally particular flight one cabin crew swearing colleague back plane apparently pulling weight poor used proud ba flyer feel like clinging airline status actually provide better service day,0.3818,Neutral

433,"  Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor.

434," On arrival at the Warsaw Airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go. Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids.

435,"  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again.

436," After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time.

They told me I'd be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I'd be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with ""That's the final amount.""

438," Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes.

439,"  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.",overall lovely flight ba edinburgh christmas holiday lounge ok quite worn although staff food nice much better travelled last time although plane seemed old cabin felt fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted liking around c funky lighting although seat economy pretty comfortable hour hop much better air france together enhanced legroom row wonderful gold card passenger ba automatically reserve row club europe enhanced legroom think great touch crew especially purser phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive need professional leaving pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering lovely short flight sandwich scone tasty actually fan well presented however simpler meal board opinion tastier give feeling trust quick hop ba ticked mark comparison cdg lhr leg air france presented chic cold starter however looked bit complicated except duck terrine rather unappetising klm served super nice simple chicken caesar paper box one big drawback first wing experience queue long decided go regular line instead quite disappointing given much money regular flyer company spend earn gold status nevertheless flight importantly crew completely negated drawback flight one way return incl transfer kirkwall pretty expensive however service seemed like worth money,0.9967,Positive

444,"  We've just used the new Club World for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration. The privacy afforded is so much better, in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. Unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared.

445,"  My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather. Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight.

446,"  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all.

450,"  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.",future travel voucher singapore london thought would perfect flight relocate home impression simple process call book onto route previously paid previously cancelled ba new date wrong first pay top flight significant amount equivalent around value original flight redemption ticket part cash part airmiles price increase fact flying peak time extra charge also meant overall paid face value online price time ticket flight well still keeping airline redeemed explained online price redemption price differ system work however taken refund would lost lot money administration fee desperate situation losing hundred pound matter cut loss booked flight least thought call centre agent previously explained working remotely manager supervision way escalate issue took card detail including full card number date cvc code explained flight ticket receipt payment extra bag would follow week later still ticket detail charge card booking reference nothing called confirm call centre agent reached apologised advised would escalate booking team took card detail waited another week sign booked onto flight thus began cycle increasingly frequent desperate call british airway repeatedly failed simple task booking flight spanning week friday monday flight sat tear another ba call centre agent promised get flight book extra bag next day around hour due fly finally got booking reference yet still failed charge add extra bag luckily noticed check detail managed add bag online whole experience stressful costly resulted spending hour day phone listening british airway hold music furthermore significant cutback ba inflight catering service due covid resulting smaller portion leaving quite hungry long flight though flown ba repeatedly problem past service gone significantly downhill,-0.3818,Negative

452,"  British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK.

Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit.

We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue.

472,"  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed.

The first nine rows were business class seats, rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin (but had been added to the business class section) which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline, unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 (I was in row 11). This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked. I complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way. I also made a formal complaint to BA but was fobbed off.

478," This was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate.

On arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake. I offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister's name but British Airways refused us to board and sent us home. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I never received these flight vouchers. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. I have had no response to my emails/messages. One BA staff member on the phone said that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me.

We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far.

492,"  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York.

Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour.

Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies).

It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier.

503,"  I’ve been flying with BA for years and never had any issues. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I’ve decided to avoid BA from now on.",flying ba year never issue recently arrange surgery budapest naturally wanted fly ba booked flight bhd bud via lhr online site booked informed hospital confirmed appointment next day received email ba telling cancelled flight bud worry moved earlier much earlier flight day problem earlier flight departed around two hour flight bhd arrived would thought would flashed system issue seemingly interlude get hungary covid one need valid reason medical treatment one fill confusing form hungarian police website confusing mix hungarian pidgin english anyway form filled flight number etc emailed authority exemption granted took earlier flight meant fly london previous evening stay overnight hotel operation booked hotel booked airport transfer booked immigration paper amended sent admiration granted flight booked could go wrong around three week due travel ba rather unsportingly decided cancel flight bud needle say furious complained ba customer service given stock excuse covid disrupting air travel great excuse looked bud arrival info ryanair flying daily least preceding several month ba covid excuse rang somewhat hollow epilogue got refunded money flight booked ba although refused refund bhd lhr flight know also lost money spent hotel half money spent booking airport transfer given cavalier attitude ba seem booking indifference ruining week preparation part fact lost inconsiderable sum money decided avoid ba,-0.9432,Negative

509,"  I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA's unique and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles.",usually avoid ba appalling customer service sneaky extra charge flight option note ba actually charge seat pre selection biz class uk pound case airline world dare saved money waited checkin choose seat free seat ba universally derided cramped across back front configuration stare face seat mate arm length away airline ever came awkward arrangement wonder preflight drink offered meal time selected one three main offering told available even though people seat biz section seat area practically storage except tiny drawer ankle level inaccessible seat lie flat position bed narrowest experienced biz class also hard cabin cold blanket thin raid blanket two seat stay warm amenity kit smallest ever seen biz class fit palm hand uncomfortable miserly experience hardly worth ba charge route used mile pay ticket course got whacked ba unique notorious fuel surcharge fee using mile,-0.3384,Negative
510,"  Aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and check-in and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient, although admittedly it’s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present. It was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms. Thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in Club Europe, the flight took off ahead of time. Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumably. Arrival into T5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule, and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control, we were through the e-gates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing.",aktion airport recently opened new facility check departure certainly seemed clean efficient although admittedly cope low passenger load present good see check carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificate passenger locator form thanks passenger board half club europe flight took ahead time service little perfunctory food reminiscent economy business class much pre packaging covid effect presumably arrival also comfortably ahead schedule although dreading many hour queuing border control e gate collecting luggage minute landing,0.8885,Positive

523,"  I was travelling back from Mexico City on a business trip. Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service.

527,"  I was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the 23rd of December to Moscow. But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines!

531,"  Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports.

534,"  I have always had great flights with British Airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing! As this was my 100th flight, I decided to celebrate it in Club Europe, which turned out to be a perfect decision. The stewards working in Club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty. Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn’t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways. Everything I expected from this flight was fulfilled. The one thing I can complain about is baggage handling at Heathrow.

They claim I traveled on AF65 and arrived in London ahead of schedule. The truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surcharge. So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there.

A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck. Disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but Terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance. An upgrade for 89 Euros one was was available but it didn't seem to make sense.

545,"  I booked flights to Rome from the US and then home through London to LAX in February of this year for the 1st of August. I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February. I had to cancel all of our hotels, AirB&Bs, car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer service a number of times, finally got through today after an hour on hold. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA. I cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for this flight.

I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great, but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began, those tickets should have been refunded. If I were to have boarded that flight, I would have been quarantined in Europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re-entry to the US IF I were able to return at all. The fact that British Airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since I do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to Spain with the travel ban enforced.

554,"  I flew with BA recently from Sydney to London, deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation. The first ticket I booked with them was via Hong Kong. After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so.

What is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times, he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us, this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here. The boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentially. I didn't try the paid Marks&Spencer on board service but I think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free. The one thing I can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet.

Next day I managed to get on board the flight. Sadly due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft on arrival to terminal 5. I was one of the last passengers to leave the plane. I realised my mistake after I passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft.

I rang the border control office at Arlanda airport. They confirmed that EU/EFTA/EEA & UK nationals were clear to enter the country. I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion. They declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy. I spent the next hour trying to get through to BA on the telephone for a refund.

561,"  A journey of 2 halves. Before hand, multiple lies and lack of information from the BA website. They cancelled my flight but they weren't honest about what they had done and lied. They claimed that I could re-book and showed lots of flights - none were in fact scheduled to fly but BA claimed that they were full. Then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that ""all journeys complete"". Website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the USA to UK. Impossible to get through to BA in London. USA BA much better - a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls. Staff at the call centre efficient and helpful. Chaos at Chicago as most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the BA flight to London and BA weren't accepting those boarding passes. No explanation for the change in policy. Everyone I saw merely handed in the American boarding pass and was given a BA boarding pass. On the plane the staff were excellent - as usual. Food was good - verging on very good. Breakfast a little small but tasty. I even got a 2nd cup of tea! Journey smooth with some sleep. I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client's data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on. I only fly BA because of the lack of choice on most routes - whenever there is an alternative I try that (not American Airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than BA).",journey half hand multiple lie lack information ba website cancelled flight honest done lied claimed could book showed lot flight none fact scheduled fly ba claimed full return booking completely disappeared website claimed journey complete website point gave indication difficult getting fly usa uk impossible get ba london usa ba much better total wait hour minute make call staff call centre efficient helpful chaos chicago passenger american issued boarding pass ba flight london ba accepting boarding pass explanation change policy everyone saw merely handed american boarding pas given ba boarding pas plane staff excellent usual food good verging good breakfast little small tasty even got nd cup tea journey smooth sleep stopped flying ba year head office poor staff ground good ba organisatiion come badly managed e g securing client data telling passenger going running decent frequent flier programme design business cabin stepping leg next passenger go loo fly ba lack choice route whenever alternative try american airline somehow consistently poorer ba,0.7275,Positive
562,"  I flew to Vancouver mid March to see my mother, then in hospital. Three days after arrival my mother passed away and I subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral. I tried to manage my booking online, as BA suggest. But, because I had bought a package that included car hire the BA site said I was unable to change this online and I had to call their customer services. I spent over 19 hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online.  I set up conversations Facebook and Twitter, they went unanswered. On the second day of my telephone ordeal I actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in ‘holidays’ who said he couldn’t help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line. When this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting I managed to blurt out my Ref number, nothing else… before that call was disconnected. Thankfully the one person I had briefly spoken to in the Duty office that night then emailed me back and I was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight. This change took about 10-15 minutes over a few emails. But the person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected. The only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company. But two days previously, when I tried to manage my booking online I was told I couldn’t do this because I had bought a package and that this could only be done by BA.

564,"  I booked my flights to the UK in May 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the UK on March 12, 2020 .. 4 days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on March 16, 2020 and because I am older and have pre-existing health conditions, my doctor asked me to postpone our trip. The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. Now the problem is, I need to rebook and use the travel credit by May 2020 for travel to the UK by May 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip. How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy. I want to rebook and travel, but I am hesitant to this at this time. Hopefully, May 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us.

594,"  Prague to London. This is the first time I have flown with British Airways. The flight departed earlier than intended and got to Heathrow about 5 minutes early. However at Heathrow, there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early. A negative was at the check-in, partly the website’s fault, as we had done the online check in. We selected the amount of bags we each had. It said we would have to pay extra, and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay £65 for each bag. Apart from those negatives and the delay, I would definitely fly this airline again.",prague london first time flown british airway flight departed earlier intended got heathrow minute early however heathrow plane way arrived early negative check partly website fault done online check selected amount bag said would pay extra spent forever checkin pay bag apart negative delay would definitely fly airline,-0.8813,Negative
595,"  Johannesburg to London. Whoever designed the refurbished Galleries Lounge at JNB has no understanding of acoustics, as every syllable of a Facetime conversation was audible 20 feet away. Add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience. Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. The White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant. Arrival at a chilly LHR was ahead of schedule and we were curbside 30 minutes after landing. Reliability is currently BA's strongest card.",johannesburg london whoever designed refurbished gallery lounge jnb understanding acoustic every syllable facetime conversation audible foot away add different language degree inebriation recipe unrelaxing experience thankfully upper deck civilised efficient slightly distant cabin crew ensured everyone fed watered hour takeoff allowing plenty time sleep food mediocre given expecting anything ba business class product white company bedding gimmick genuine enhancement breakfast become rather perfunctory pastry bread apart solitary croissant arrival chilly lhr ahead schedule curbside minute landing reliability currently ba strongest card,0.8176,Positive
596,"  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient.

597,"  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong.

602,"  Mumbai to Boston via London. My flight with British airways was really good. The catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good.

They have a really weird policy that you can't carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead, you have to check it in. The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in Boston. Also, they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in Boston 24 hrs after I had come. Even after contacting BA'S Baggage Customer Service, they were speaking rudely to me. They always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern. British Airways needs to improve their ground experience.

604,"  Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines.",toronto geneva via london stopped flying ba three year ago dramatically downgraded service apparently thing improved somewhat since decided give another try overall happy experience save two major gripe plus side flew new aircraft comfortable albeit usual narrow seat modern aircraft airline legroom generous seemed official pilot good informative always ba quality food long haul definitely improved since bad old day soggy pasta droopy sandwich rather enjoyed meal served nice large tray ife adequate though surprisingly dated new aircraft cathay pacific far superior two major downside new basic economy fare really pesky serf disgruntle passenger ba really need get rid virtually everyone long haul check bag please include airfare type wanted nickle dimed fly gatwick charter airline also able choose seat even time check infuriating automatically allocated middle seat even though entire rear half plane empty go show get middle seat unless pay thankfully lady check changed window seat free charge asked nicely complimentary catering short haul seeing virtually passenger flying heathrow connecting long haul flight ba spent least airfare resented drink snack included short haul segment trip ba treating connecting passenger low cost airline paid dollar short trip ba would get rid two new feature would hesitate fly everything else trip pleasant would still consider airline,0.9863,Positive

After take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. And we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. We contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around. To cap it off, we landed at 10pm ET and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller. We finally received them back 2 days later.

614,"  Overall a very comfortable flight with British Airways. Both of my flights took off on time and reached on time. I was really excited to fly BA since they changed the aircraft from Boeing 777-200 to a Boeing 747-400 which is known as the queen of the skies.  The flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off. Everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds. On my second flight to Mumbai, the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service.

619,"  Gatwick to Tirana. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service.

620," Keflavik to London Heathrow. Cabin crew were amazing. Weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough. Expecting a delay and seeing other European flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding. Snow in blizzard conditions, we were surprised but got settled in our seats. Crew very friendly and a long story short after 3 hours on the ground waiting for the di-icing machine we finally made our way to take off. All the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the BA online app to help them. Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time.

No warm greeting, just a job's worth high handed attitude. Neither of the BA reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly.

653,"  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing.

654,"  Brussels to Bangkok via London. Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats 15C and 15D. It was a Boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I’m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough.

657,"  London to Johannesburg with British Airways. BA’s B gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the Galleries Lounges in the main terminal. It’s also a tad closer on the transit - or via the rather useful walkway on level -4 - to the C gates where the A380s depart from. The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films. The dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. Trolleys may lack glamour, but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight. Breakfast was adequate but nothing more. Landing was exactly on time.

Without a shadow of a doubt, the whole British Airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight.

668,"  London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019.

672," Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well. The flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly. I always recommend BA - and will continue to do so.",tirana london gatwick fly british airway around six time month thanks work almost always pleasant experience past flight definitely outdid others boarded departed exactly time friendly welcoming crew flight fully booked travel companion lucky one sitting row could empty middle seat therefore space best surprise flight far availability wi fi never british airway flight within europe fact wi fi package got included texting unlimited incredibly fast good home connection truly made flight enjoyable allowed continue business even flight extremely valuable something british airway improve would leg space flight noticed particularly tight although common problem cm tall also unknown reason food snack served hour minute flight drink slight struggle skipped breakfast managed well flight however arrived ahead schedule de boarded quickly always recommend ba continue,0.9884,Positive

679," London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update!

680,"  London to Cape Town. We had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to Africa. I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA for a segment for better connection timing through London to Cape Town. This was a huge mistake. I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again.",london cape town booked business class ticket year advance trip africa usually fly star alliance picked ba segment better connection timing london cape town huge mistake tried reserve seat ba website twice able tried call ba twice gave hold hour time call back option arrived today london toronto connection desk seven hour flight told business class oversold would downgraded premium economy ba representative told u reserved seat bottom list business class loyalty customer would priority seat u would still welcome lounge bonus problem u clear security get lounge since could print boarding pass due grade took close hour get settled lounge time first arrived connecting desk asked speak manager four interaction ba staff told would get speak u giving impression trying pas unhappy customer fast could one point got visibly frustrated ba staff issuing new boarding pass indicated grade voluntary definitely two half hour ba customer service manager came speak u first one actually apologetic tried address situation customer oriented perspective british airway think giving bulkhead seat premium economy basic lounge access paying business class passenger adequate customer service downgrade paid business fare upcoming overnight flight booking flight ba,0.9531,Positive

At Gatwick, there are no arrival/departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online. When asked the BA guy at the lounge kiosk, he said I could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are. Surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update. At the gate, we were told the aircraft was replaced. No apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight. We boarded at 5 pm and took off at 18:15. Stiff and no recliner seats.

695,"  My flight from London to Singapore in premium economy was the worst I have experienced. The seat was uncomfortable, the flight tracker failed after two hours, the breakfast prior to arrival in Singapore (scrambled egg) was like rubber. They ran out of cups and so my wife and I had no coffee, tea or drink with our breakfast. I used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than 30 minutes. Eventually I made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they would come back. I never saw the crew member again.

I asked for an ale, the attendant pretended not to understand what I was asking for. I repeated many times the word ale with my Spanish accent, but she still did not catch it. The male attendant said “like an IPA”, I answered “yes”.  I changed to a beer and she offered me Amstel or Heineken, I chose Amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable. When the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me. For the meal I chose the beef and asked for a beer. The male attendant realized that the empty can was still there, took it. With the food on my and no drinks I started to eat, after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming, so I stopped another attendant going to Business class and he came back with an option of Tiger or Heineken lager.

Even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over, it took 45 minutes before my bag came through. The baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive, by which time I was running to catch my next flight on a different airline, which I missed. Turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasn’t for another 6 days. Hoping that British Airways would help us in some way, we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent, basically told us to pound sand.

The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight.

717," I wish I could give a zero. I was booked on a flight from Newark to Madrid via London. I come to find that the minimum layover time in London is 1 hr. My flight layover in London was 1hr5min. British Airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in London were the same, but that was a total lie. My wife and I were sprinting across the airport, but between getting off the aeroplane, having to go through security again, and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection, we missed the layover flight. We had the same route in the reverse direction. I called BA hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation. They kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than London’s minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way. British Airways has by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ryanair which is a no-frills airline has better customer service and that is saying something.

722," We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars!

724,"  I did not actually fly because of their pilot strike. This review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike. I immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. I completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28.

725," The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later.

728," Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.",booked flight week ba strike mistakingly thinking strike would ended two day flew fact day apprehensive would operate check security clearance took minute personally like self service bag tag drop ba operate one confident everything correctly boarding new fare group system depends much one paid ticket fan possibly due previous day strike need accommodate passenger canceled flight aircraft large boarding however smooth board virtually full cabin clean eurotraveller seat comfortable offer sufficient leg room cm knee touch seat front departure minute behind scheduled departure time flight cabin staff euro traveller cabin believe club cabin efficient friendly one wait minute take purchase refreshment full flight shame though ba gone frill line charge food drink describe full service airline landing tegel minute ahead schedule pleasant flight value good combined hotel booking tegel bit hassle border police carrying immigration control passenger end airbridge minute wait luggage ba fault,0.9618,Positive

734,"  London to Dublin. It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way.

735,"  Hong Kong to London. An email on the 25th August advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone, what a total awful nightmare.

A broken screen in seat 59A (it would not stay in position and without wedging, unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him.

744,"  Orlando to Gatwick. Travelling home was extremely disappointing. The aircraft was dirty - drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt. The aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers. The aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off, so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult. The breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar. Only one drinks run was made.

747,"  Sydney to London via Singapore with British Airways. I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables, I am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up. The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights.

748,"  London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight.

But I feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions. Regardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. We all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day afterwards. Customer service was outstanding. So compassionate and helpful. And again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for their help. I will only ever fly BA on long haul if possible.",good morning would like write review british airway took write review took get happened feel way british airway behaved need review valiant effort last year went year old son year old friend new orleans london holiday life time pregnant time baby died holiday turmoil emotion regardless tried make holiday positive experience son friend carried wanting go home treatment needed take place england somehow missed flight back excuse realised complete state break rang ba sobbed phone beyond amazing arranged flight back home day without extra cost sat together able fly home day hospital day afterwards customer service outstanding compassionate helpful ask penny return flight beyond grateful help ever fly ba long haul possible,0.985,Positive
757," My flight was cancelled 3 days in a row. Was flying out on Thursday and finally after days and hours of arguing with BA, I got a flight out Saturday night with Swiss Air. They on the other hand actually fly and on time. Everything about the customer service, customer relations has been terrible, hours of waiting on the phone, no answers on email. My other flights with BA this year has been delayed too. They have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of 700$. First 10 days, then 21 bank days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the money yet. So far nothing and the complaint has been turned over to CAA and the Danish Aviation Authority.",flight cancelled day row flying thursday finally day hour arguing ba got flight saturday night swiss air hand actually fly time everything customer service customer relation terrible hour waiting phone answer email flight ba year delayed two month promised reimburse expense pay penalty fine first day bank day way passed anything else transferred money yet far nothing complaint turned caa danish aviation authority,-0.5736,Negative
758,"  Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it.

759, London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. This was a very similar experience outbound and inbound. I am sure the plane was the same. I am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen BA. I am seriously considering not doing this again. The 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old. I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. That time at least we received AVIOS.

761," From Toronto to Pisa British Airways used a wet leased Air Belgium plane. Crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily. Food was excellent. Business Class cabin comfortable. Weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at LHR. To our great surprise British Airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family (7 people ranging from 3 to 62 years) from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3, escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to Pisa.

762," A very good service on board this flight with British Airways from LHR to VCE. Although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an Airbus A319 to and Airbus A320, we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time. The crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean (probably because the plane was relatively new). The seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room. One small issue that I could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board, you had to pay or use Avios (it isn't that bad as it was only to Europe). An overall very good experience on board this flight.",good service board flight british airway lhr vce although flight minute delayed due aircraft change airbus airbus arrived slightly behind scheduled arrival time crew welcoming informative plane clean probably plane relatively new seat bad either quite good leg room one small issue could raise complimentary food beverage board pay use avios bad europe overall good experience board flight,0.8016,Positive
763," This was the worst experience I have ever had flying. There was sufficient time in Chicago to transfer our bags from American Airlines. AA verified that they delivered the bags to BA but they were not on our flight when we reached London. The bags did not arrive and we spent two days in London without our bags. I left a earphone hard case on the plane, but your Lost and Found never answered to file a claim. Your website was horrible to use to file this claim and I have heard nothing.

The aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time. During the flight drinks were served and two food services. Towards the end of the flight I developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring. So despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger BA really came through for me.

Having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with BA so far this summer, I felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home I was rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which I had to wait over a day for - was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft. We were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day! Some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Utterly appalling.

774," A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. Between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business.",supremely awful experience beginning end flight vancouver delayed hour due plane defect resolved previous day somehow attempt made make time told board problem delay baggage reclaim meant get vancouver airport midnight originally scheduled arrive pm affected camping trip booking could changed flight home marred massive queue baggage check plane due fault none communicated seated plane told could leave passenger information could get crew due fault inflight entertainment working nothing watch hour flight food awful got choice one meal spent hour heathrow airport awaiting flight home inverness told text one hour departure cancelled queued hour get information someone rebooked flight hour later without checking ok discovered day later handed boarding pas mean missed trip friend edinburgh festival source hotel food etc reclaim expense lot money coming account whilst wait seeing rebooked flight already delayed told customer service telling whether bag arrive wait baggage reclaim see flight information expect belonging back merely significant issue really shocked consistently terrible service provided massive fine data breach fact ba seem quite consistent severe issue beyond comprehension still business,-0.9526,Negative

776,"  London to Nice. I agree totally with the comments made in Michael Croft's review today. My flight to Nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable IT system that BA have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs. The handling of the situation at Heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that BA encounter these days, they would have got this part of their act together. They make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue, when clearly they have not been investing where they should, instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses. Not just the CEO should go, but some others at the top.",london nice agree totally comment made michael croft review today flight nice cancelled result low cost unreliable system ba senior management likely celebrating somewhere managed cut cost handling situation heathrow despicable would think failure ba encounter day would got part act together make problem bolt blue clearly investing instead focussing cost cutting boost performance bonus ceo go others top,0.8689,Positive

Got to Heathrow 1.5 hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutes a 3rd appeared. 45 minutes later a BA guy asks for Vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through. There was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? Waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding. Got to Las Vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bag. Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us. No apology just a shrug of shoulders. During day receive offers from BA to upgrade to Club class and I try at least 10 times to book but website does not process. Speak to BA at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising, get through to Manager who admits the BA website is the worst and advises to keep trying.

786,"  London Heathrow to Malaga in business class. Full and very large Club Europe cabin on this morning flight. Held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why. On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting. BA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed. Male cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic customers in front, which was a shocker.",london heathrow malaga business class full large club europe cabin morning flight held airbridge min boarding word reason boarding cabin staff entrance stood chatting amongst totally ignored customer great start usual cabin service except staff slightest bit interested customer service paid premium business class realised waste money breakfast standard full english charter flight standard despite ba shout gone considerable cost cutting ba perform well good day seems cabin service getting le consistent day staff preparing go strike well since attitude displayed male cabin staff quite offensive arabic customer front shocker,0.3817,Neutral

791," Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again.",johannesburg cape town return flight operated comair thus quite different normal british airway flight europe check priority line uneventful however return guy counter know oneworld sapphire could check business class counter kept asking flying business johannesburg airport cape town domestic terminal laid similarly lounge called slow actually impressive although full english offer unlike british airway gallery lounge place substantial amount savoury snack pastry small bite even coffee counter made order drink assume later day also becomes bar serving alcohol impressive domestic business class lounge priority boarding honoured boarding orderly process would recommend anybody wanting get extra legroom seat reserve row actually ton legroom front reserved exit row paid extra per exit row booking seat old plush however prefer newer leather seat used european aircraft offer better support also noticed boarding business class slightly larger seat x configuration expect business class europe normally blocked middle seat several drink service two hour flight hot breakfast either bacon sausage scrambled egg option cheese omelette vegetable option needle say hot meal two hour flight appreciated also rather tasty tasted quite fresh crew friendly making casual joke giving earth friendliness rarely get airline day quite rushed understandable due short flight time cape town airport actually quite weird see use airbridge stair passenger deplane board since took minute board rather full work make sense think flight improved opinion british airway price competition south african airway would curious next visit see two compare given fact giving near homologous product africa busiest air route price paid happy fly,0.9917,Positive
792,"  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.",grenada gatwick flown ba aircraft type prior refurbishment intrigued experience change cabin cabin much smarter previous aircraft looked tired lighting pleasant entertainment system hugely improved good selection medium larger touch screen device suppose reason appreciated old system hopelessly outdated family really found entertaining real issue tight leg room slim ft lack seat width made almost impossible eat meal tight previously seat format sat outbound although return sat near back economy aircraft narrow seat become sat bearable also found seat really hard couple hour although sitting supplied back rest cushion helped bit despite best effort sleep failed remember old seat comfortable especially long haul service professional timely food similar previous flight edible summary seems shame ba improved aspect experience seat comfort sacrificed great pity,0.9336,Positive

800," Premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The food (I use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn’t bother trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother!

Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours.

814," New York to Glasgow via London. A routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7). I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. It was supposed to be funny and engaging.

818,"  BA 2616 and 2617 return trip from Gatwick to Cagliari. Both flights on a Saturday and were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BA.

823,"  I had some difficulty from the start, after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in, even though I was already logged in. I wanted to reserve seats and request special meals. It took me 2 days to achive this. I was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the LHR-KUL and return KUL-LHR legs. I had difficulty checking in using the BA app and eventually did it using Malaysia Airlines app. Checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in Kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference. I was looking forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but it really is just a dream. Food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. For an over 12h flight, I think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times. Toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy. The IFE selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music.

I then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget.  2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the TV and Radio feature. When the dinner was served, Ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash, along with bread butter and a mousse.

I  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system, and was assured they were.

832,"  Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.",belfast city atlanta via london heathrow check fairly smooth belfast early morning however agent called check flustered elite executive club member although boyfriend checked agent without difficulty knew working premium line nobody standing standing regular line called minute finally got boarding pas go security flight bhd lhr uneventful bare bone nothing served free flight boyfriend therefore hated used getting better service american u fully aware ba turned glorified easyjet arrived lhr continued atlanta ba shocked crowded user unfriendly although suppose pretty way sit one dank cattle pit hold people flight called felt crowded hot flight called found crowded shuttle plane pushy people boarding straightforward however flight attendant polite helpful customer even economy flight product ok view exit row aisle seat extra room nice headrest seat right lav stank ife fine decent selection complete delta food bland equivalent delta serf brownie point tea service terrible given half sandwich plastic wrap without tray limited selection beverage remember year ago ba premium carrier served nice thing passenger friendly smile smile disappeared part feeling flying special carrier longer however arrived time promptly got bag also nice spacious flight attendant polite might fly though would recommend ba due crowd discomfort experienced,0.9442,Positive

The flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound Boeing 787-9 from San Jose. The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology.

The process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes. When the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternity. In the 45 minutes it took us, the queue never dropped below about 100 people. I have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk.

I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding.

845,"  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen.

From the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic. Crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive. Food was good, not great, but very good. Seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review). Again, the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run.

847," CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience.",cpt definitely getting act together ba gallery lounge spacious good selection food staff actually managed make group boarding work upper deck still one better bet flying club world despite ancient yin yang seat tiny ife screen appalling resolution new bedding certainly help cushion hard seat large pillow actually feel luxurious dinner service according new cw soft design meant delay plate brought passenger individually whole think work triple bread roll already tray mean bread want rather served dessert breakfast streamlined staff actually paid attention request card filled takeoff apart inevitable turbulence flight went according plan touched minute ahead schedule good flight overall old style business class experience,0.891,Positive
848,"  Sofia to Belfast via London. The legroom on the Sofia to Heathrow flight was terrible. I am not tall, but my knees were pushing against the seat in front.  Service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. Where did the service go? There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts. The delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation. The Belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3-hour flight from Sofia.  I will never set foot on this airline again.

851," I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me.

853,"  
Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. Overall, the return flight was extremely poor.",gatwick barbados return normally travel ba low expectation result disappointed sometimes pleasantly surprised outbound flight par course reasonably comfortable seat ok cabin crew enough look u make flight uneventful however flight leave bang time managed land barbados virgin flight scheduled leave gatwick five minute u result got arrival quickly return flight week later managed reinforce low expectation ba one poorer flight experienced last year travel west east crew specifically one lady looking part cabin somehow feel rush every part drink meal service becomes ordeal pre departure drink missed seat left hand side pe cabin big deal irritating non le bread served dinner despite butter plate presume missed wife ordered veggie meal served ten minute everyone else fine however crew serving remaining meal continual dialogue across two aisle selection respective trolley reached row somehow thought would good idea try pas hot tray chicken gravy across four middle seat result red hot gravy spilled wife remaining food lap although fortunately napkin place absorbed liquid also spilled kindle thankfully cover closed brief apology given without sincerity suspect blissfully unaware obvious mistake made wife wine replaced rest dinner landed time good thing overall return flight extremely poor,0.6364,Positive
854,"  Marseille to London. I am generally annoyed with the quality of the service. I believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a BA flight. I realised that I forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control. I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. Luckily, I decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3, where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the BA staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me.

856,"  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. Overall a decent flight, and very good value as I paid using avios.

857,"  Boston to London Heathrow, was excited to experience A380 for the first time. Paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was good but not as good as some long haul carriers. If both legs had similar cabin crew and food I would have scored them higher.

858,"  London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched.",london cape town first first taste new soft product still unfortunately year old refurbishment showing age wardrobe door falling hinge non touch touch screen cupboard door washroom stay shut pas muster first blemish impression positive change board service young mixed fleet crew reasonable job served drink food efficiently without wait reviewer complained care also taken preparing plating food nothing overcooked even beef decent bedding also improved good quality duvet large pillow ife remains low re screen quality new headphone uncomfortable worn duration single film goody bag much better worth taking home overall pretty good flight remains seen ba long tooth first class new club suite launched,0.9646,Positive

866," Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed.

The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew.

868,"  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight.

877,"  Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways.",bucharest london flight british airway hour delayed european destination london applied compensation delay initially informed eu regulation would receive euro compensation informed day later error longer getting compensated british airway argued sickness crew member considered extraordinary circumstance comparable weather issue therefore compensate passenger flight however court precedence case clearly show crew sickness considered extraordinary circumstance airline responsibility contingency strategy case compensate talked manager customer service told nothing policy believe legal basis british airway compensated customer service reason hour delay within europe significant many time picked fly british airway based expectation good customer service case anything going wrong experience proved worth investing extra money flying british airway,-0.7068,Negative

879,"  Madrid to London. We paid for business class and then paid for specific seats. The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. We'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS has always reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, again. Just simply poor BA  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business class.

880,  Dublin to London Heathrow. British Airways offered a very good overall service on this flight. I booked online and found that process very easy. The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort.

881,"  London to Seattle. My seat was on the upper deck, a nice perk for Seattle flights to Europe (BA is the only one flying 747s to Europe from Seattle). Overall the product is outdated. Service was not at the level it used to be. Staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum.  Upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum.  No additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flight. Of course if you ask for something you do get it.

Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight.

When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German.

Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points.

891,"  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards.

Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous.

905," Heathrow to Larnaca - departed on time, flight nearly full. M&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout.

913,"  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business.",gatwick st lucia return recently returned two week holiday wife caribbean th birthday celebration ticket bought august decided spoil club class return flown premium economy arrived airport told downgraded premium economy due overbooking apologetic ground staff defending indefensible apology plane fuming way back london exacerbated hopeless cabin staff service tea asked coffee filthy food complained return ba exec club webiste response customer service day later ba claim overbooking rare occurrence gave lukewarm apology evidence ground staff journey contradicts seems standard occurrence peak season booked early probably relatively cheap seat ba presumably made money selling ticket higher bidder general quality ba service food wine fallen dramatically last year ba effectively low cost airline flying fleet tired aircraft trying preserve gloss quality airline accountant may win short term passenger vote foot avoid airline possible final insult booking premium seat ba get charge pre reserve club premium economy ba laugh flying public performance deserve stay business,-0.8555,Negative
914,"  It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA. Is this because competition is hotting up and BA now have to try harder?",many year since flew long haul british airway pleasantly surprised recent flight ba staff used offhand inhospitable changed time arriving london heathrow staff really friendly helpful similarly flight attendant enough requested tomato juice worcester sauce attendant made special trip rear get way back asked tonic water offered go get seating newer plane allows knee room even though ft in headrest slid high enough entertainment system though little quirky operation menu system compared slickness cathay pacific nevertheless good range movie tv watch flight ended arriving time despite delay heathrow way pilot kept u cheerfully informed going food quality reasonable standard cathay pacific rather let filled croissant breakfast thought bit mean overall pleasant flight thanks ba competition hotting ba try harder,0.9822,Positive
915," 
London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine.

Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job.

917,"  Gatwick to Mauritius. My wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. The return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (I am a licensed engineer).

921,"  Chicago to London Heathrow. Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten.

I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming.

934,"  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them.

937,"  I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us.

939,"  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight.",tokyo london looking forward flight club world ticket first time flying boeing good check experience breezed airport enjoyed jal lounge narita boarded time first impression boeing good modern plane nice mood lighting boarded food wine really good beautifully presented japanese starter followed bento style lunch final reminder holiday wife chose western option plenty choice ife big screen downside cabin hot made difficult sleep flight problem encountered outbound journey seat comfortable reclined fully find layout ba club world little awkward step another passenger footrest access aisle cabin crew efficient seemed bit exhausted could friendly welcoming context review spoiled flew first class way tokyo amazing experience comfortable seat exemplary service cabin crew felt bit disappointed return flight comparison felt room improvement time expectation might high previous flight,0.986,Positive
940,  London to Tokyo Haneda. My wife and I treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to Japan with the help of my Avios and a BA Amex companion voucher. We were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at Heathrow was great. We boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint. We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably.

950,"  I've always favoured British Airways and will always try and choose to fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel. I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. However BA have stripped both the above perks. I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double. Then today I flew back from Denmark with SAS, and it was amazing and made BA look cheap.

952," A380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand.

The 2-3-2 seating in the front section of Club World on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers.

The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats.

We checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats (for the 4 of us) remained unbooked. We had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats, and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets. Only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. Cabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all. Breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee. Impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds.

962," I understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as BOAC go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible. I paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat. I understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there? In my case, they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign. It is baffling. The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am I flying BOAC? They owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flight. On top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15"". For normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must've been. And of course you only get compensation by patronising them again.

VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that.

969,"  We recently flew from London to Bologna, the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin bags into the hold with checked in luggage to save space. So we did, when we arrived my carry on bag which has accompanied me on many flights over the past 3 years was damaged and beyond repair or use for our further journeys. So I approached the damaged/lost baggage area, lodged a claim and provided all the evidence, explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the bag asap. I was advised by the representatives to ring BA service line. Made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim. Well it is still going, despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded. They instead asked me to produce receipts from 3 years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciation.

979,"  Newark to Bangalore return via London on BA premium economy (World Traveler Plus). I paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. Was it worth it? I'd say broadly yes, though I wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. Before Boarding: Premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and India to US/Canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). So I am not sure if I got an extra bag or not but I did use the 2 bag allowance Boarding: You board in Zone 3 after First/Business & the oneworld elites. That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. This means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at Heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. In Flight: There is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). There is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: The 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. So a somewhat wider seat. Seat pitch is also decent. These are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. The food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). There is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. There is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. You do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. The seat back screen is large and easy to use. There is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used on the LHR-BLR sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. This gives it a sort of cosy feel. You do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. Economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and I had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. That helped me stretch out for sure. The seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. Food: Nothing much here. I didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. It was OK - nothing to write home about. All in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. Worth it on extra long haul like US to India. Bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs.",newark bangalore return via london ba premium economy world traveler plus paid premium economy extra approximately per leg worth say broadly yes though want pay much would harder justify one leg hour involved boarding premium economy get standard checked bag allowance whereas economy bag though numerous exception allow india u canada one exception though clear applies travel originating either end sure got extra bag use bag allowance boarding board zone first business oneworld elite helpful get dibs overhead storage fit premium economy always put front behind economy begin boarding mean also get fairly quickly help hurry get security heathrow connecting flight immigration final destination flight welcome drink premium economy champagne juice water depending departure time also hot towel service also cabin nicely done premium economy cabin seating opposed economy somewhat wider seat seat pitch also decent new style slimmer seat though possibly le cushioned get older seat seat comfortable food tray come armrest seat back storage though much small drink tray built front arm rest share neighbor recliner style footrest support calf get noise canceling headset nice basic amenity kit eyeshade sock toothpaste seat back screen large easy use restroom cabin one immediately behind economy long walk cabin seating premium economy club world opposed economy version used lhr blr sector small premium economy cabin row seat give sort cosy feel walk way economy section immediately behind get restroom economy looked pretty full leg premium economy full seat next vacant leg helped stretch sure seat back screen old much smaller seat older possibly cushioned slimmer seat food nothing much think different regular economy meal would ok nothing write home long journey premium economy product offer additional comfort along early boarding baggage worth extra long haul like u india bit harder justify shorter flight fewer leg,0.994,Positive

My costs would  be reimbursed. The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. I felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty +300 GBP fare for a short haul flight for the next day. As it was Christmas, prices were very high. After I arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started, and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).

981,"  London to Mumbai. I have had my battles with the leadership at BA because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their Airmiles. Now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn Airmiles through their credit cards. This is just to illustrate that I boarded BA199 with a slightly negative mindset, a mindset which was changed quickly. Although I travelled Economy, the seat was comfortable, the service excellent, as was the food. If I have a minor quibble, the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old. Is this BA's attempt to reduce costs, because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product. I was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (e.g. water bottles, duty-free carrier bags) into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine.

983,"  Our return journey from Sydney to London, which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at Singapore airport, was faced with one major issue. We flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn’t working. Having paid £723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. I also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to me. There was no other alternative or any means of reasoning. The flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable.

984," I had flown British Airways from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow as a part of my journey back home (Thailand) on the 12th December 2018. I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic. Overall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better.",flown british airway leeds bradford london heathrow part journey back home thailand th december arrived leeds bradford hour early queue check counter check process took le minute already done online check mean dropped luggage staff airport friendly helpful passed security control waited aircraft boarding process mess priority boarding flew economy boarding group luckily every passenger could board front rear door aircraft parked remote stand aircraft old cabin modern clean seat comfortable good wing view downside seat second last row back seat pitch short luckily tall problem aircraft delayed due slow boarding process weather condition crew friendly helpful captain always announce information whole flight let passenger know cause delay flight information flight departed crew started board service buy anything food option poor expensive paid credit card one hour flight expect top service standard flight arrived london heathrow time despite traffic overall flight service crew made flight enjoyable improve food boarding process better,0.9808,Positive
985,"  Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.

987,"  Johannesburg to London. I had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. The only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast.

I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time.

990,  Our flight from Seattle to London in November 6th was canceled due to technical problems. After waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the BA associate couldn’t find us any immediate flight. They offered us a flight that would arrive in London late November 8th. It would take us 16 hours. Since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in November 8. I would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive. My trip was supposed to be 4 days so by the time of arrival I had to return in less than two days. They advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking. I filed a claim online based on their instruction.  The customer relation phone number is disconnected. In fact the automatic voice mail says “please don’t chase a call”!

991,"  Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish.

992,"  Moscow to London. Fantastic first class service. The Moscow lounge was surprisingly good, with excellent Runway views. Quick boarding, and I was escorted to my seat by the crew. The new First seats on the 787-9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product. There's plenty of space, a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space. The 23 inch flatscreen IFE screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones. The dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic, the best airline meal I've had. Drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival. The crew were very attentive and friendly with it. A fantastic experience, and I'll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin.",moscow london fantastic first class service moscow lounge surprisingly good excellent runway view quick boarding escorted seat crew new first seat fleet real upgrade older product plenty space cupboard several little storage bin addition overhead bin space inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality sound quality excellent thanks noise cancelling headphone dinner menu extensive food fantastic best airline meal drink constantly topped boarding arrival crew attentive friendly fantastic experience look forward next opportunity fly cabin,0.9902,Positive
993,"  Johannesburg to London . For supper I asked for warm / hot water to make milky drink as I don't drink tea or coffee for health reasons. Given with no problems. For breakfast I requested the same and I was refused. I explained I don't drink tea or coffee but milk and water."" We don't keep hot water, I can get it once we have finished serving all other customers"". That never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger. I kept my sugar, milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water, explaining I have been waiting. He said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back. I felt like a nuisance, deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing.",johannesburg london supper asked warm hot water make milky drink drink tea coffee health reason given problem breakfast requested refused explained drink tea coffee milk water keep hot water get finished serving customer never came lady called take care unwell passenger kept sugar milk stirring stick asked another male cabin crew collecting tray breakfast warm water explaining waiting said bring second never came back felt like nuisance deliberately ignored couldnt bother anyone flight started bumpy preparation landing,0.5165,Positive
994,"  Bridgetown to Gatwick. Booked our return flight in Business/Club Class (at £1,000+ each) only to find BA want to charge an extra £80 each to choose our seats.  Awful seating with their Ying/Yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin. Poor cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told ""We only do that in First class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that"". I was almost asleep when I was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - This happened 3 times, a sort of sleep deprivation torture. If you are expecting business class levels of service, and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed.",bridgetown gatwick booked return flight business club class find ba want charge extra choose seat awful seating ying yang seating arranged like sardine tin poor cabin staff attitude asked seat made bed told first class would everyone cabin staff almost asleep disturbed food drink passed serving hatch otherwise known privacy screen inner seat happened time sort sleep deprivation torture expecting business class level service ability sleep overnight flight sadly disappointed,-0.9425,Negative
995,"  Glasgow to New York via London. Morning flight from GLA to LHR was ok. I really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights! We left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to JFK. On the JFK flight the service was fantastic. The meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight. We left and arrived on time. The seat and legroom was fine. My mothers IFE didn't work and she was moved seat, which she appreciated. The cabin crew were very friendly.",glasgow new york via london morning flight gla lhr ok really miss complimentary breakfast morning flight left time arrived plenty time make connection jfk jfk flight service fantastic meal nice offered plenty drink throughout flight left arrived time seat legroom fine mother ife work moved seat appreciated cabin crew friendly,0.9669,Positive
996,"  Sydney to London via Singapore. I'm hugely disappointed with the Business class trip. The seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you're next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. After I watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) I was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. The ""new releases"" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. Once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats. I would not recommend BA to anyone.",sydney london via singapore hugely disappointed business class trip seating arrangement leave little desired e isle interrupted cabin crew passing food collecting tray person sitting inside refer seat guru understanding service slow food good luck getting rid tray minute next window need extremely athletic go toilet climb someone leg order get seat drink available bar could le appealing tried good luck trying get one cabin crew extremely elusive get drink careful leaving unattended pull tray two drink slip teflon type surface spill arm seat dont get started flight entertainment lack watched two movie hour flight scratching find anything else decent watch new release contradiction term little priority giving business class boarding plane sure called first plane configuration ultimately join queue board rest economy locate seat economy filing passed get seat would recommend ba anyone,0.9329,Positive
997,"  Johannesburg to London. In contrast to our excellent outbound experience, inbound lacked the wow factor. The cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance. Cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding. The dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights. My IFE touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month. Sleep quality was reasonable, although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant. Breakfast was pretty good. Arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic Comair flight.",johannesburg london contrast excellent outbound experience inbound lacked wow factor cabin full dominated passenger seemed want demonstrate importance cabin crew adequate rather outstanding dinner service unremarkable cheese board shrunk size two flight ife touchscreen struggled respond finger press selection film different previous month sleep quality reasonable although high cabin temperature made duvet redundant breakfast pretty good arrival time relieved find bag made way domestic comair flight,0.9702,Positive
998,"  Antigua to Gatwick. One of the worst business class experience. Entertainment system didn't work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution. Service super slow 2-3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers. Food bad, beef over cooked, mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting. Nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed.

999,"  Gatwick to Barbados. First class was third rate. A disgusting cabin, crumbs on the seat, dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls - it looked as though it hadn't been properly cleaned for days. Poor service and an entertainment system from a different age. I have avoided flying with BA for the last 20 years, now I remember why. Avoid them if your route allows.",gatwick barbados first class third rate disgusting cabin crumb seat dirty carpet finger mark control looked though properly cleaned day poor service entertainment system different age avoided flying ba last year remember avoid route allows,-0.8807,Negative
